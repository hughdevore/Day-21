# Day-21

<h1>Goal:</h1>
The goal for the Day-21 homework was to build out a backbone framework for a video game web application. 

<h1>Update:</h1>
I have completed the skeleton and plan on completing the following before adding this project to my portfolio:

- a collection containing gameModels with {user, password, highscore} properties to the backbone framework
- a game to the "PlayView", I have yet to decide on whether I would like to create a simple animated game or utilize a pre-existing game code (tetris, etc.)
